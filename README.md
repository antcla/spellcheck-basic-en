## Notes

1. Took the word list from https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/a5cd0b8/data/words/common.json
2. My solution does not handle conjugations or pluralization, I would fix this next
3. I pasted a portion of a Wikipedia article into the Textarea default value, so we can immediately see how it works and its shortcomings.
4. With more time, I would highlight words in the Textarea, probably using https://www.slatejs.org
